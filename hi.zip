What is cybersecurity all about?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.
 These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; 
 extorting money from users through ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.
Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are 
more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.
A successful cybersecurity posture has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, 
networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, a unified threat 
management gateway system can automate integrations across products and accelerate key security 
operations functions: detection, investigation, and remediation. People, processes, and technology 
must all complement one another to create an effective defense from cyberattacks.
People
Users must understand and comply with basic data protection and privacy security principles like 
choosing strong passwords, being wary of attachments in email, and backing up data. Learn more about 
basic cybersecurity principles from these Top 10 Cyber Tips (PDF).
Processes
Organizations must have a framework for how they deal with both attempted and successful cyberattacks.
 One well-respected model, the NIST cybersecurity framework, can guide you. It explains how you can 
 identify attacks, protect systems, detect and respond to threats, and recover from successful attacks.
Technology
Technology is essential to giving organizations and individuals the computer security tools needed to
protect themselves from cyberattacks. Three main entities must be protected: endpoint devices like computers,
smart devices, and routers; networks; and the cloud. Common technology used to protect these entities include
next-generation firewalls, Domain Name System (DNS) filtering, malware protection, antivirus software,
 and email security solutions.
Why is cybersecurity important?
In today's connected world, everyone benefits from advanced cybersecurity solutions. At an individual level,
 a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft to extortion attempts, to the loss of 
 important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning.
Everyone also benefits from the work of cyberthreat researchers, like the team of 250 threat researchers
 at Talos, who investigate new and emerging threats and cyberattack strategies. They reveal new vulnerabilities,
  educate the public on the importance of cybersecurity, and strengthen open-source tools. 
  Their work makes the internet safer for everyone.
